# Elm 0.19 readiness helper

This small project is meant to help you keep track of transition state of your dependencies in your own Elm app to Elm 0.19.

## How does it work

Copy JSON form your `elm-package.json` into the prepared field and hit the button. You will see which of your dependencies are already on 0.19 version and which are still pending.

There are buttons for quickly navigate to dependency Github so you can track progress or even help with package transition.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Elm App](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app).
